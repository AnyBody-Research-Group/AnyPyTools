AnyPyTools's documentation!
======================================

AnyPyTools is a toolkit for working with the AnyBody Modeling System (AMS) from
Python. Its main purpose is to launch AnyBody simulations and collect results.
It has a scheduler to launch multiple instances of AMS utilising computers with
multiple cores. AnyPyTools makes it possible to run parameter and Monte Carlo
studies more efficiently than from within AMS.
